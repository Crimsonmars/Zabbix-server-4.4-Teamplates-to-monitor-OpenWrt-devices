# Zabbix-server-4.4-Teamplates-to-monitor-OpenWrt-devices

This are the files I have modifyed from https://pastebin.com/nQdZM89w in order to load them in to regular Zabbix server 4.4
The above all in one I havenÂ´t done, as I am unsing this as an addon to standard Linux template with the following openwrt packadges:


zabbix-extra-wifi
zabbix-extra-network
zabbix-extra-mac80211
zabbix-agentd


As the inital compatibility was 2.0, I guess they should work fine from 2.x to current version 4.4
If you want an export of my working ones please let me know.


Enjoy.
